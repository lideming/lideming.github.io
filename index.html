    <p>Hi, I am Li Deming, not only a full-stack website developer. No more self-introduction because this is a (so-called) toolbox.</p>
    <p>I know. This frontpage is so ugly. (UPDATE: now it's better but still ugly.)</p>
    <p>But it is a page of a website and written in standard HTML for real.</p>
    <p>I am not going to write any fancy code to make it fancy. I hate front-end!</p>
    <p>Just kidding, it's just under construction. I did write such code.</p>
    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>Here <del>are some tools</del> is some tool you and I may use:</p>
    <p><a href="toolbox/countdown.html">Countdown Timer</a></p>
    <p>More tools are <del>(maybe not)</del> comming soon!</p>
